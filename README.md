Generate an HTML Nikto Report for Metasploitable VM: Step 1: Run Nikto against the Metasploitable VM using the following command: bash Copy code nikto -h <Metasploitable_IP> -o report.html Step 2: The report will be saved as an HTML file, which you can open in a browser or upload to GitHub.
Grab the Banner for a Metasploitable VM Port Using Netcat and Save a Screenshot: Step 1: Use Netcat to grab the banner for a specific port (e.g., HTTP on port 80): bash Copy code nc <Metasploitable_IP> 80 Type HEAD / HTTP/1.0 and hit Enter twice to get the banner. Step 2: Take a screenshot of the terminal displaying the banner.
Upload to GitHub as TaskSeven: Step 1: Commit the OpenVAS PDF report, Nikto HTML report, and the banner screenshot to a local GitHub repository. Step 2: Push them to the repository under a directory called Taskseven. Let me know if you need detailed guidance on any of these steps.

Step-by-Step Guide to Grab a Banner with Netcat: Open a Terminal: Open your terminal on the system where you have access to the Metasploitable VM.

Identify an Open Port on Metasploitable VM: You can use Nmap to find open ports on the Metasploitable VM. Here's a command to scan:

bash Copy code nmap -sV <Metasploitable_IP> Use Netcat (nc) to Grab the Banner: Once you identify an open port (e.g., Port 21 for FTP or Port 80 for HTTP), use Netcat to connect to that port. For example, if you're connecting to Port 80 (HTTP):

bash Copy code nc <Metasploitable_IP> 80 After running the command, type:

bash Copy code HEAD / HTTP/1.0 Then press Enter twice. This will send an HTTP request and the server will respond with a banner.
